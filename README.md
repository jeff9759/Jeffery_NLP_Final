Abstract:

Testing is crucial for educators as it's their main way to gauge students' grasp of subjects. It's important to design high-quality tests that address various levels of domain knowledge. Often, educators use Bloom's taxonomy to set educational objectives in cognitive, affective, and psychomotor areas. Current research mostly sorts questions into broad domains, highlighting a gap in models that can differentiate between categories and their subcategories. This paper presents a model that classifies Jeopardy questions into specific categories, such as 'History' and its subcategory 'American History', using a bag of words approach and the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) statistic to identify key words' relevance in a text collection. By training a logistic regression model on 1,167 'History' clues and 1,216 'American History' clues, the model achieved a 78.6% accuracy rate. This indicates that TF-IDF based semantic vectors can effectively separate questions into a category and its subcategory in Jeopardy.
